# Employment Platform

Employment Platform is a school project that given in Data Structures Lecture. 

As its name implies main idea of this project is finding job. You can find a job or find employees for your company. It uses ".dat" files as databases. Sample data is included in "EmploymentPlatform\bin\Debug" (with backup). This is homework project so there may be pointless buttons, codes etc. You can check what our Instructor wanted from us in "DS_16_3A.doc" document. I also included project report (in Turkish). This project report contains programmer's catalog and user's catalog. Every class and its methods explained in programmer's catalog and usage of program is explained in user's catalog.
